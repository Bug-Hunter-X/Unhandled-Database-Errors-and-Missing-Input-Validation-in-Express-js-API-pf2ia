# Unhandled Database Errors and Missing Input Validation in Express.js API

This repository demonstrates a common vulnerability in Express.js applications: unhandled database errors and a lack of input validation.  The `bug.js` file shows the vulnerable code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

## Vulnerability

The original code lacks proper error handling when interacting with the database (`db.createUser`). If the database operation fails (e.g., due to a network issue or invalid data), the error is silently swallowed, leading to unexpected behavior or application crashes.  Additionally, it's vulnerable to injection attacks because user input isn't validated before being used in the database query. 

## Solution

The solution demonstrates best practices:

* **Error Handling:** Uses `try...catch` to handle potential database errors.  Appropriate error responses are sent to the client.
* **Input Validation:** Validates the incoming user data before passing it to the database.  This helps prevent data corruption and security vulnerabilities.
* **Asynchronous Handling:** Uses `async/await` to handle asynchronous database operations in a clean and readable way.

This example highlights the importance of robust error handling and input validation in building secure and reliable Express.js applications.
